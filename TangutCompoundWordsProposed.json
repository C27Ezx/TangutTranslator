    "Reasoning/Explanation": "To translate 'system,' I've compounded 𗹙 (law) with 𗳻 (straight). This calques the Chinese idea of a 'system' (制度 zhìdù - often implies 'rule'/'law' and 'order'/'straightness')."

    "Proposed Tangut Word": "𗬖𘘱𗳷",

The third character 𗳷 (lure) is included as an educated guess for its rolling or perhaps a unique feature, similar to how Chinese 犰 qiú is often part of 犰狳 qiúyú.

    "Reasoning/Explanation": "The Tangut lexicon has 'casket' (𗜒) and 'bag' (𘙝), but no direct 'box.' Since boxes vary in size, 'much casket' 𘜒𗜒 (śju2 kha) (using a classifier/size morpheme before 'casket') could theoretically indicate a larger container like a box or chest. If 𗜒 refers only to small caskets, then perhaps a more general 'container' could be derived from 'bag' (𘙝) or 'cover' (𗀫). For 'box' I will use 𗜒."
