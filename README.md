## 💬 What is this?

A simple Python script to **translate** between **English and Tangut** (or vice versa) using a massive dataset of ~6000 known Tangut entries. This isn't some AI model or grammar engine — it's **word-by-word**, **brute-force**, and **barebones**... and yet, incredibly effective for what it is.

This tool is perfect if you:
- Want to explore Tangut vocabulary fast.
- Are building learning resources.
- Want to see some seriously awesome Unicode glyphs like `𘘮`, `𗵻𗒐`, `𘚜𗅋𘒛` in your terminal.
- Just love ancient scripts and languages.

## 🗂 Data Source

- The 6000+ entries come from [tangut.info](https://tangut.info/) — a monumental site by **Alan Downes**.

Made with love and Unicode 🔥  
Note: Ensure to download a font that supports Tangut Characters for displaying them, I recommend using the Tangut Yinchuan font which you can find on: https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/Yinchuan.html
